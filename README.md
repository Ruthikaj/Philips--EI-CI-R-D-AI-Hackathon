Problem Statement:
Indiaâ€™s healthcare system suffers from fragmented coordination, delayed critical care, and underutilized high-value resources. During crises and routine operations alike, the lack of real-time visibility, communication, and intelligent orchestration leads to avoidable delays, patient anxiety, and financial losses. An AI-powered command layer can transform this chaos into a streamlined, responsive, and patient-centric system.
 
Challenges to Solve:
Real-Time Resource Orchestration:
Dynamic allocation of ICU beds, ambulances, and scanning equipment based on real-time availability and patient acuity.
Smart Dispatch and Routing:
AI-optimized ambulance dispatch and rerouting of patients to available scanners or care units to reduce delays.
Care Coordination and Staff Readiness:
Automated alerts to nurses and technicians for patient prep and equipment readiness, minimizing idle time and bottlenecks.
Patient Communication and Transparency:
Real-time updates via SMS/WhatsApp about delays, rescheduling, or room changes to reduce anxiety and improve trust.
Clinical and Operational Decision Support:
AI-driven insights for hospital administrators and clinicians to make fast, informed decisions on resource allocation and patient flow.
Dynamic Slot Management:
Identification and filling of cancelled or empty slots in real time to maximize equipment utilization and throughput.
Expected Impact:
Reduced Mortality and Morbidity: Faster critical care admissions and ambulance response during emergencies.
Increased Equipment Utilization: Minimized idle time of high-value assets like scanners, improving ROI and patient throughput.
Operational Efficiency: Automation of administrative tasks and proactive coordination reduces staff burden and delays.
Enhanced Patient Experience: Transparent, real-time communication reduces uncertainty and builds trust.
Data-Driven Decisions: AI insights enable smarter, faster decisions in high-pressure environments.
